- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunyqs
- 👀 I’m interested in social influence of new media. My resarch interests include online deviant behaviors on social media and online games, such as toxic behavior, incivility, trolling, and misinformation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, NLP, and machine learning in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on textual analysis of social media comments, information flow in social networks, and emergence of collective intelligence.
- 📫 Reach me at sunyqs@gmail.com
