- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunyqs
- 👀 I’m interested in the social influence of emerging technologies. My research interests include 1) online deviant behaviors on social media and online games, such as toxic behavior, incivility, and trolling; 2) the spread and impact of misinformation; and 3) the ethical development of responsible AI. 
- 🌱 I’m always learning Python, NLP, and machine learning in general.
- 🌱 I'm working on big-scale network experiments looking at the diffusion of misinformation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on textual analysis of social media comments, information flow in social networks, the emergence of collective intelligence, and bias perpetuated by gen AI and LLMs.
